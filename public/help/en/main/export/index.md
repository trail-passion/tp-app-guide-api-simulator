# Export {{icon name: export}}

You can export your trace in a file of three possible formats:

* __KML__: Use this file in [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com/web/).
* __GPX__: Commonly used with GPS devices.
* __TP__: Trail-Passion genuine file.
Use this format if you want to keep all the options of your trace.
But this will work only with Trail-Passion tools.
